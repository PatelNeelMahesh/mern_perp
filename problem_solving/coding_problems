3) Klaus Mikaelson and his daughter Hope were arguing about who is the smartest person in the family. Klaus who is a world-known Computer Engineer asked Hope who has not yet completed her college to write a program to sort the given array in ascending order. Can you help Hope?
Input Format:
Input consists of 1 integer and 1 array.
The integer corresponds to the size of the array.
Output Format:
The output consists of array elements after sorting.
Sample Input 1:
5
54
68
25
14
74
Sample Output 1:
The sorted array is:
14
25
54
68
74
Explanation:
Here we can compare the 1st value(54)with all the other values,54 is greater than 14 and 25 and hence 54 will get printed in the third position.
Repeat the same process for all the remaining values to get the output in sorted order.

def sort_Ascending(N,Arr):  
    for i in range(len(Arr)):
        for j in range(len(Arr)):
            if Arr[i] < Arr[j]:
                Arr[i], Arr[j] = Arr[j], Arr[i]
    return Arr

10) Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximise the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
 
Example 1:
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

Example 2:
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

 

Constraints:
1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1

13) Given a binary string S consisting of 0s and 1s. The task is to find the maximum difference of the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s – number of 1s) in the substrings of a string.
Note: In the case of all 1s, the answer will be -1.
Example 1:
Input : S = "11000010001"

15) A bus stop queue has n groups of people. The i-th group from the beginning has ai people. Every 30 minutes an empty bus arrives at the bus stop, it can carry at most m people. Naturally, the people from the first group enter the bus first. 
Then go the people from the second group and so on. Note that the order of groups in the queue never changes. Moreover, if some group cannot fit all of its members into the current bus, it waits for the next bus together with other groups standing after it in the queue. Your task is to determine the number of buses needed to transport all n groups to the Jeju Island countryside.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The next line contains n integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ m).

4 3
2 3 2 1
Sample Output 1:
3
Explanation:
Here there are 4 groups of people and an empty bus can accommodate 3 persons.1st group of people will go in one bus(2), then the second group of people will go on the next bus(3) and then 3rd and 4rth group of people can go in a single bus(2+1). Hence the total number of buses is 3.

Sample Input 2:
4 4
3 3 3 3
Sample Output 2:
4
Explanation:
Here there are 4 groups of people and an empty bus can accommodate 4 persons. Each group of people will go on each bus. Hence the total number of buses is 4.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,1,2} 
Output: 2
Explanation: The candles' length reduces by 1 in 1 day. 
So, at the end of day 1: Sizes would be 0 0 1.
So, at the end of day 2: Sizes would be 0 0 0. 
This means the room was illuminated for 2 days.


Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2,3,4,2,1} 
Output: 4


23) Mark is a student who used to compare everything. One day he thought of comparing two arrays and check whether it is compatible or not. Two arrays are said to be compatible if they are of the same size and if the ith element in the first array is greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all the values of i. Help Mark to write a program to find whether 2 arrays are compatible or not.
Input Format:
Input consists of two values and two sets of integers
The first integer corresponds to ‘n1’, the size of the first array. 
The next ‘n1’ integers correspond to the elements in the first array. 
The next (n+1) integer corresponds to 'n2', the size of the second array. 
The last 'n2' integers correspond to the elements in the second array. 
Output Format:
The output consists of any one of the two strings "Compatible" or "Incompatible".
Sample Input 1:
5
2
3
6
8
1
5
1
1
1
1
1
Sample Output 1:
Compatible
Explanation:
Both the arrays are of the same size and the ith element in the first array is greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all the values of i. Hence the output is Compatible.


Sample Input 2:
5
2
3
6
8
1
5
1
1
1
1
2
Sample Output 2:
Incompatible
Explanation:
The size of both the arrays is not equal and the ith element in the first array is not greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all the values of i. Hence the output is Incompatible

26) A character string is said to have period k if it can be formed by concatenating one or more repetitions of another string of length k. For example, the string ”abcabcabcabc” has period 3, since it is formed by 4 repetitions of the string ”abc”. It also has periods 6 (two repetitions of ”abcabc”) and 12 (one
repetition of ”abcabcabcabc”).
Write a program to read a character string and determine its smallest period.
Input Format:

27) You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

28)You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.


29) Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 
Example 1:
